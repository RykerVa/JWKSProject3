Below is a screenshot of the most completed work, I could not get the AES to work as I could not get the program to run when I tried to implement the decrypt and encrypt features. When tyring to run after implementing "I would get AES key not found in environment variable NOT_MY_KEY". 

All authentication and even rate limiting is completed and can be run as normal.
